A dog is a Class. He has mood = “HAPPY”, energy = 100, coordenatePosition = (0,0).
He can Bark, Run, MoveLeft, MoveRight, MoveForward, Lay and Check. 
To Run he used MoveForward(2), his energy decreases in 1, his mood is “PLAY” and return 0.
To MoveForward he needs numbersSteps, his coordinatePosition[0] increases in numbersSteps, his mood is “MOVING”, decreases energy by 1.
To MoveLeft he needs numbersSteps, his coordinatePosition[1] decreases in numbersSteps, his mood is “MOVING”, decreases energy by 1.
To MoveRight he needs numbersSteps, his coordinatePosition[1] increases in numbersSteps, his mood is “MOVING”, decreases energy by 1.
To Bark he print “barf, barf”, his energy decreases in 1, his mood is “BARKING”.
To Lay he used print “relax”, he used print “move the Booty”, his energy increases in 3.
To Check he print “mood: ” + self.mood, he print “energy: “ + str(self.energy), print “Position” + str(self.coordinatePosition)
